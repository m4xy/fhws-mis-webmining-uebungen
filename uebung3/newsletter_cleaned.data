 Is SMARTDRV.EXE causing bad sectors on my hd?From: jdriver@netlink.cts.com (John Driver)Message-ID: <uo6o3B3w165w@netlink.cts.com>Date: Tue, 27 Apr 93 20:18:05 PDTOrganization: NetLink Online Communications, San Diego CALines: 47        I am having something very unusual happen.  First some background on my system.  I have a Mitsubishi 63 meg Hard Drive, and am running Smartdrv (the version that comes with Windows 3.1) on it.  I rarely use Windows.  I use a program called Disk Technician Gold v1.14 to do diagnostics live time on my hard drive.  It works by having a device driver detect whenever more than one read is necessary for a file, or if there is anything else is wrong with it, and minor problems are fully checked out upon rebooting.  My hard drive is notorious for bad sectors.  I usually end up with 8 new bad sectors a week.         Here's what happened:  I ran a program, and DTG broke in with an Emergency Warning and recommended I reboot.  It gave me this message twice before the program was fully loaded.  I exited the program and did just this.  DTG went through its bootup process, examining for new errors etc., and a screen popped up and said something about sectors for a brief period of time.         I then went back to the program, executed it again, and the exact same error was detected.  I rebooted and tried again, and the same error happened again.  So, I removed DTG from memory, and went to the program to see if I could detect anything wrong.  Sure enough there was a number of read attempts.  So I rebooted and reloaded DTG, but removed the cache.  I executed the program.  No read errors, either audible or detected by DTG.  I quit the program, loaded the cache, and ran the program again.  The errors were detected.         Ok, so the errors are there, and DTG detects but doesn't fix them, when the cache is loaded.  When the cache is not loaded there are no errors.  So, to see if the cache was interfering with any other files, I went into xtree gold and tagged all files, and searched them for a random string (in other words, I wanted the program to completely read every file on my hard drive).  Before I got through the c's DTG had detected at least six errors and recommended I reboot.         Does anybody, have any idea why Smartdrv is causing misreads on my hard drive?  Oh, there are exactly two misreads per file, and 1 in about every 100 files are affected.           I originally posted this message to Disk Technician Corp.'s system, but I figured someone out in netland may know enough about smartdrv to help me out.--                    INTERNET:  jdriver@netlink.cts.com (John Driver)UUCP:   ...!ryptyde!netlink!jdriverNetLink Online Communications * Public Access in San Diego, CA (619) 453-1115
 Why I'm not using Dos 6 anymoreLines: 18I've been running Dos 6 for about a month.  I was generally impressed withthe improvements:  the multiple boot configurations were great, thenew commands were nice, and DoubleSpace worked fine (twice as slow forlarge data transfers, twice as fast for small with SmartDrv).Until now.This morning at 4 am while I was working on my research paper, I had toreboot a hung Dos program (that did no disk i/o) from within Windows 3.1.When my machine finished rebooting, I found my windows directory and about twothirds of my other directories were irreversibly corrupted.I cannot afford problems like this.  I'm returning to Dos 5.markP.S.  I've also noticed bad sector errors from DoubleSpace where none should      exist.

Also, the experience of widespread use of trucks for domestictransport during WW 1 convinced the government that good raods werecrucial to our national defense.  Anyway, by the 20s there were plentyof good roads, at least around urban areas, and they were rapidlyexpanding into the countryside.  This was the era, after all, of thefirst auto touring fad, the motel, the auto camp ground, etc. Two goodbooks on the subject spring to mind - Warren Belasco "America on theRoad" (title may not be exact - author is) and another called "The DevilWagon in God's Country" author I forget.  Also, any of John Flink's  orJohn Bell Rae's auto histories.As to placement of the steering wheel being arbitrary, by the earlyteens there were virtually no American cars that did not have the wheelon the left.  In the early days, cars had the wheel on the left, on theright, and even in the middle, as well as sometimes having a tillerinstead of a wheel.

Lets beginby saying that its whole rear end was definately Hawk 650.  Additionally,it had a CBR900RR style tank, full fairing, and only a tach.  Now, atfirst I thought it was an 'RC31' (a Hawk modified by Two Brothers Racing),but I did not think that they made this huge tank for it.  Additionally,the gauges were certainly not from a Hawk.  They looked much more like 900RR gauges.  Overall, the bike looked like a 900RR except for therear single-sided swingarm and wheel (there were straight from the Hawk)So, what did I see?(PS, for any of you Boulder DoDers, I saw it parked at the Engineeringcenter today.

While I was waiting my turn to state my case andplea of why I was going 75 in a 55 in my cage, I had the opportunityto listen to some of the "creative excuses" offered the judge by others.After listening to a number of "Well, I was passing a very slow truckthat suddenly speed up" versions, I decided that the judge had heardjust about every story in the book and then some.  He was less thanimpressed with any of them.This young, rather burley looking guy, had his docket read by arather drill sargent looking Ohio State Highyway Patrol Trooper.He was clocked riding a motorcycle at a speed of 110 mph in a 55 mphzone.  It was also noted that the defendant (motorcycle rider) hadalcohol on his breath, but was not cited for this offence.The judge looked over his half glasses purched on the end of his noseand said in his sternest voice: "Well son, those are some prettyfast speeds to be riding a motorcycle.  What do you have to say foryour self?""Well Sir", meekly the defenant replied, "I just was over to mybuddys and we had a couple of beers and I was on my way home."He offered nothing more or less.  Just had a couple of beers andwas doing 110 mph on his way home.The judge moved by the simplicity of the response, fined him themaximum in this case (plus court costs of course) and ordered himto attend remedial drivers training school.Isn't America Great??--------------------------------------------------------------------Bill Mohrman                                         81-CB900CMotorola , SPSColumbus, OH------------------- Disclaimers Apply ------------------------------

 Disappointed by La CieMessage-ID: <1993Apr5.173853.14752@umiami.ir.miami.edu>Date: 5 Apr 93 17:38:53 EDTOrganization: Univ of Miami IRLines: 52Approximately four months ago, I purchased a Quantum 240LPS HD from La Cie for$649. After two months, the drive started having problems. First, there wereintermittent freezes, then corrupted files and resources, then Silverlining5.41 wouldn't even recognize the drive. So I got an RMA from La Cie andexchanged the new drive for a reconditioned one.Well, about a month has passed now and the second drive is having problems.Often, when I boot up my IIsi I get the flashing question mark. Sometimes, if Ithen insert the Silverlining (5.42) program I can get it to recognize the driveby making it scan over and over for drives. At that point I can restart theIIsi and boot from the HD. I've called La Cie again and they've given meanother RMA. Their tech support people tell me that if Silverlining doesn't seethe drive there's a definite hardware problem.Given that this is the second bad drive in four months, I asked La Cie to sendme a *new* one, but they said "no." Also, within three weeks after I purchasedmy original drive, La Cie dropped the price on it by over $100.I can accept that a drive (or two) may be bad. And I know that hardware vendorsmake a practice of sending reconditioned replacements when they do repairs. AndI understand that the nature of the computer industry lends itself to suddenprice fluctuations. Nevertheless, taken together, the convergence of thesefacts/events have left a bad taste in my mouth. (I should have added above thatwhen I asked La Cie to transfer the contents of my current drive to the onethey will send_I think the data is still in good shape and I'll have to againreinstall everything from floppies_they said it would cost me $250 for datarecovery.)It seems to me that reconditioned hardware should be sold as reconditioned at adiscounted price, and that replacements for new hardware gone bad (stillcovered under a 90-day warranty) should be new. I feel a little helpless about all this. I don't mean to necessarily flame LaCie_their support staff have always been friendly and sometimes even helpful.But c'mon. Sometimes a little extra customer service goes a long way. (I senta letter to La Cie's customer service when the first drive was returned and Iasked them for a credit on the price difference since I had purchased the drivethree weeks before they slashed the price. I told them I would like to applythe credit toward the purchase of another La Cie product. They didn't even have the courtesy to reply one way or the other.)What's the moral of this story? I'm not sure. But I do know I won't buy anyother products from La Cie in the future.Bill Krauthammerf2ehg786@umiami.ir.miami.eduPS Please don't email or post about how good your La Cie product and servicehas been. I'm not suggesting that they are not a good company or anything likethat. All I'm saying is that I've had a disappointing experience with them andI'll be taking my business elsewhere in the future.

 Re: IIsi clock upgradeMessage-ID: <C532M3.DzJ@ux1.isu.edu>Organization: Idaho State University, PocatelloReferences: <1993Apr3.165013.13822@cdf.toronto.edu>Date: Tue, 6 Apr 1993 22:32:26 GMTLines: 47Hi, I have been getting a lot of requests for this information so I thoughtI would post it for those interested parties. (Sorry for length).To increase the MacIISi speed to 25MHz or 33MHz the clock must be changedfrom 40MHz to 50MHz or 64MHz respectively.This is done by going to a static-free work station or putting somealuminum foil down to work on.	1. Open up the Si by lifting the tabs at the back of the case.	2. Remove the Hard Disk by disconnecting the power and SCSI cables,		spreading the tabs, and lifting the drive out.	3. Remove the flopy drive.	4. Remove the power supply by spreading the tab in front and lifting		the supply straight up and out.	5. Remove the fan by pressing the ears together at the back, bottom		side of the fan and lifting straight up and out.	6. Remove the Mother Board by spreading the tabs on the left and		right side of the board and sliding the board forward then		lifting the board out. (all connectors on the back of the		board must be removed first)	7. Desolder the 40MHz clock (the one closest to the memory modules).		This is not easy even for a skilled solderer.	8. Get an IC socket with the round pins and remove four of the pins		by pushing them up from the bottom with long nose pliers.	9. Put the four pins in the holes vacated by the clock and solder 		them in.	10.Insert a 50MHz or 64MHz clock.	11.Put large power transistor heat sink's on the processor chip and 		the other large chip just to the right of the processor and		figure some way to hold the heat sync's in place. I made a		simple clamp by putting a four inch screw up through the hole		in the board between the two chips. Mount the screw using		insulated washers. Screw a cross member down over the heat		sync's to hold them in place. Don't use too much pressure.	12. Put it all back together and go-for-it.Disclaimer: this is only the procedure I used and is not authorized by anyone.	    You are on your own for this procedure. I'm quite sure it will	    void your warentee.Bye for now,************************************************Ralph Durtschi    (208) 236-3256Idaho State UniversityEMAIL:  durtralp@ux1.isu.edu************************************************

 Ram boards on a 486??Message-ID: <1993Apr15.165610.18895@oracle.us.oracle.com>Sender: usenet@oracle.us.oracle.com (Oracle News Poster)Nntp-Posting-Host: monica.us.oracle.comReply-To: ebosco@us.oracle.comOrganization: Oracle Corp., Redwood Shores CADate: Thu, 15 Apr 1993 16:56:10 GMTX-Disclaimer: This message was written by an unauthenticated user              at Oracle Corporation.  The opinions expressed are those              of the user and not necessarily those of Oracle.Lines: 27Hello,	I have a 486sx25 ISA machine with Pheonix BIOS.  Currently I have  8 megabytes of RAM installed via eight 1 MG SIMMS on the motherboard: ie.  both banks are full, and there is no space for more SIMMS.  I am thinking  of running OS2 on my machine and Possibly Linux with X windows, and I know  that more RAM would be helpful.  However with SIMMS, the only solution I  can see is to sell my 8 Megs for about $180, and by 4 4mg SIMMS for about  $400 used. Apart from the fact that I can't afford the price right now,  the entire process of selling RAM and buying it used probably means that  the machine might be down for a number of days which I would rather  avoid...So my question is, do the AT RAM boards that plug into a free slot work  well with a 486 ISA machine. I have seen some being sold used for about  $90 with 4 Mg with space for another 4Mg's.  If these boards do work, how  do they do it?  Is a device driver needed, or will the BIOS pickup the  extra RAM as it does with the SIMMS on the mother board? I know that the  ISA expansions slots are 16-bits and 486 SIMM memory is 32 bits, so  probably all of this is just wishful thinking... However any help is truly  appreciated.-Ericebosco@us.oracle.com

 Western Digital HD info neededDate: 15 Apr 1993 14:59:00 -0400Organization: Oakland University, Rochester, Michigan, U.S.A.Lines: 34Message-ID: <1qkb9k$788@vela.acs.oakland.edu>NNTP-Posting-Host: vela.acs.oakland.eduI was recently loaned an older Dec 210 286 at work, and I have the optionof adding an additional Western Digital Hard-drive to the machine.  Theexisting drive is currently a Western Digital as well, and is working fine,but I do not have any documentation available for configuring the master/slaverelationship necessary for a c: d: drive setup.The first drive is currently formatted to Tandy Dos v3.3 but I am eventuallygoing to upgrade both to MS Dos v 5.0The drives themselves are both model number WD95044-A circa 5-07-1991They are 782 cyl 4 head drives.  A note to add is that there is no exactconfiguration for these in my current bios, but it seems to work at asetting 17 (977 cyl 5 head, 300 write_pre, 977 landing zone).There are three pairs of jumper pins on the back that I presume arefor setting up the master/slave.  Originally, the drive in the machinehad none.  Currently, I was suggested to try the far right (looking at theback) for master and the middle jumper for the slave.When booted, the reinitialize seems to puke accessing the d: drive.  It doesflicker about three times on the second drive, but then gives the error.  Hopefully the problem is as simple as the drive not being formatted, but notbeing a person who has ever had to actual format and unformatted drive, Iwould not even know how to do that.Any and all help on this is great fully appreciated.

All other uses must receive prior permission in writing Xfrom both Landon Curt Noll and Larry Bassel.XXABOUT THIS FILE:XX    This file is intended to help people who wish to submit entries toX    the International Obfuscated C Code Contest (IOCCC for short).XX    This is not the IOCCC rules, though it does contain comments aboutX    them.  The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions.X    Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules areX    allowed.  Even so, you are safer if you remain within the guidelines.XX    You should read the current IOCCC rules, prior to submitting entries.X    The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines.XXXWHAT IS NEW IN 1993:XX    The entry format is better (for us anyway).  The program mkentry.cX    has been updated.  See ENTRY FORMAT.XX    We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI CX    compiler.  Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers X    fits are no longer permitted.  Some of the new issues deal with X    non-integral array types, variable number of arguments, C preprocessor X    directives and the exit() function.  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES.XXXHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS:XX    You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests.  SeeX    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners.XX    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year, so some winning entriesX    may not be valid entries this year.  What was unique and novel one yearX    might be 'old' the next year.XX    An entry is usually examined in a number of ways.  We typically applyX    a number of tests to an entry:XX	* look at the original sourceX	* convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCIIX	* C pre-process the source ignoring '#include' linesX	* C pre-process the source ignoring '#define' and '#include' linesX	* run it through a C beautifierX	* examine the algorithmX	* lint itX	* compile itX	* execute itXX    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests.X    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has beenX    'cleaned up' by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier.XX    Your entry need not do well under all, or in most tests.  In certainX    cases, a test is not important.  Entries that compete for theX    'strangest/most creative source layout' need not do as well asX    others in terms of their algorithm.  On the other hand, givenX    two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the entry thatX    does something interesting when you run it.XX    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules.  As such, we leaveX    the contest open for creative rule interpretation.  As in real lifeX    programming, interpreting a requirements document or a customer requestX    is important.  For this reason, we often award 'worst abuse of theX    rules' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way.XX    If you do plan to abuse the rules, we suggest that you let us knowX    in the remarks section.  Please note that an invitation to abuseX    is not an invitation to break.  We are strict when it comes to theX    3217 byte size limit.  Also, abusing the entry format tends toX    annoy more than amuse.XX    We do realize that there are holes in the rules, and invite entriesX    to attempt to exploit them.  We will award 'worst abuse of the rules'X    and then plug the hole next year.  Even so, we will attempt to useX    the smallest plug needed, if not smaller.  :-)XX    Check out your program and be sure that it works.  We sometimes makeX    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem, particularlyX    in or near the final round.  On the other hand, we have seen someX    of the best entries fall down because they didn't work.XX    We tend to look down on a prime number printer, that claims thatX    16 is a prime number.  If you do have a bug, you are better offX    documenting it.  Noting "this entry sometimes prints the 4th powerX    of a prime by mistake" would save the above entry.  And sometimes,X    a strange bug/feature can even help the entry!  Of course, a correctlyX    working entry is best.XXXOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES:XX    Doing masses of #defines to obscure the source has become 'old'.  WeX    tend to 'see thru' masses of #defines due to our pre-processor testsX    that we apply.  Simply abusing #defines or -Dfoo=bar won't go as farX    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion.XX    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code, and so do we:XX	#define d defineX	#d foo		   <-- don't expect this to turn into #define fooXX	int i;X	j;		   <-- don't use such implicit type declarationX	int k;XX    We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler.  If you X    must use non-ANSI C, such as K&R C, you must avoid areas that result in X    compile/link errors for ANSI C compilers.XX    Unfortunately, ANSI C requires array indexes to be of integral type.X    Thus, the following classical obfuscation hacks are no longer allowed:XX	int i;X	char *c;X	i[c];		   <--- use c[i] insteadX	(i+3)["string"];   <--- use "string"[i+3] insteadXX    If your entry uses functions that have a variable number ofX    arguments, be careful. Systems implement va_list as a wide varietyX    of ways.  Because of this, a number of operations using va_list areX    not portable and must not be used:XX	* assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variableX	* casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variableX	* passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list argX	* passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list argX	* performing arithmetic on va_list variablesX	* using va_list as a structure or unionXX    In particular, do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **'s.XX    Avoid using <varargs.h>, use <stdarg.h> instead.XX    If you use C preprocessor directives (#define, #if, #ifdef, ...),X    the leading '#' must be the first character on a line.  While someX    C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading '#', many do not.XX    Because the exit() function returns void on some systems, entriesX    must not assume that it returns an int.XX    Small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise.X    While such programs are not as complex as other winners, they doX    serve a useful purpose.  They are often the only program that peopleX    attempt to completely understand.  For this reason, we look forX    programs that are compact, and are instructional.XX    One line programs should be short one line programs, say around 80X    bytes long.  Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion.XX    We tend to dislike programs that:XX	* are very hardware specificX	* are very OS or Un*x version specificX	     (index/strchr differences are ok, but socket/streams specificX	      code is likely not to be)X	* dump core or have compiler warningsX	     (it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item)X	* won't compile under both BSD or SYS V Un*xX	* abusing the build file to get around the size limitX	* obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri-graphsX	* are longer than they need to beX	* are similar to previous winnersX	* are identical to previous losers  :-)XX    Unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering theX    'best one liner' category, we suggest that you format your programX    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines.XX    The build file should not be used to try and get around the sizeX    limit.  It is one thing to make use of a several -D's to help out,X    but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -D's in order toX    try and squeeze the source under the size limit.  You should feelX    free to make use of the build file space, but you are better offX    if you show some amount of restraint.XX    We allowed whitespace, and in certain cases ; { or } do not impactX    your program size (up to a certain point), because we want to getX    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters.XX    Given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blobX    of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical CX    program, we tend to favor the second version.  Of course, a thirdX    version of the same program that is formatted in an interestingX    and/or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two!XX    We suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating'X    program.  We are amazed at the many different sizes that claimX    to be the smallest.  There is nothing wrong with self-replicatingX    programs.  In fact, a number of winners have been self-replicating.X    You might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest', lest we (or others)X    know of a smaller one!XX    X client entries should be as portable as possible.  Entries thatX    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored.  Don'tX    depend on a particular type of display.  For example, don't dependX    on color or a given size.  Don't require backing store.XX    X client entries should avoid using X related libraries andX    software that is not in wide spread use.  We ask that such X clientX    entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and theX    Athena widget set (libX11.a, libXaw.a, libXmu.a and libXt.a).X    Don't use M*tif, Xv*ew, or OpenL*ok toolkits, since not everyoneX    has them.  Avoid depending on a particular window manager.  NotX    everyone has X11r5, and some people are stuck back in X11r4 (orX    earlier), so try to target X11r5 without requiring X11r5.

The Email messageX    is unpacked into individual files, each containing:XX	---entry--- sectionX	all ---author--- sectionsX	all ---info--- sectionsX	---build--- sectionX	---program--- sectionX	any other text, including the Email message headersXX    Prior to judging, the 'any other text' file is scanned to be sureX    it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry wasX    malformed and did not unpack correctly).  Information from theX    ---author--- sections are not read until the judging process isX    complete, and then only from entries that have won an award.XX    The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particularX    individual.  We are usually kept in the dark as much as you areX    until the final awards are given.  We like the surprise of findingX    out in the end, who won and where they were from.XX    We attempt to keep all entries anonymous, unless they win an award.X    Because the main 'prize' of winning is being announced, we make allX    attempts to send non-winners into oblivion.  We remove all non-winningX    files, and shred all related paper.  By tradition, we do not evenX    reveal the number of entries that we received.  (for the curious,X    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCCX    winners at talks)XX    After the Usenix announcement, we attempt to send Email to theX    authors of the winning entries.  One reason we do this is to giveX    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented theirX    entry.  They are given the chance to correct mistakes, typos.  WeX    often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well.X    This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world.XX    Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds.  During a round,X    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles;X    the pile that advances on to the next round, and the pile that doesX    not.  We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in theX    previous round.  Thus, an entry gets at least two readings.XX    A reading consists of a number of actions:XX	* reading the ---entry--- sectionX	* reading the uudecoded ---build--- sectionX	* reading the uudecoded ---program--- sectionX	* reading the uudecoded ---info--- section(s), if anyX	* passing the source thru the C pre-processorX	    shipping over any #include filesX	* performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the sourceX	* passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processorX	    shipping over any #include filesXX    In later rounds, other actions are performed:XX	* linting the sourceX	* compiling/building the sourceX	* running the programX	* performing misc tests on the source and binaryXX    Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries, entriesX    are judged on an individual basis.  An entry is set aside because itX    does not, in our opinion, meet the standard established by the round.X    When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries, we begin to formX    award categories.  Entries begin to compete with each other for awards.X    An entry often will compete in several categories.XX    The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entriesX    we receive.  A typical category list might be:XX	* best small one line programX	* best small programX	* strangest/most creative source layoutX	* most useful obfuscated programX	* best game that is obfuscatedX	* most creatively obfuscated programX	* most deceptive C codeX	* best X client (see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES)X	* best abuse of ANSI CX	* worst abuse of the rulesX	* <anything else so strange that it deserves an award>XX    We do not limit ourselves to this list.  For example, a few entries are soX    good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round.X    We will invent awards categories for them, if necessary.XX    In the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks ofX    reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10X    winners.  Often we are confident that the entries that make it intoX    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do notX    make it.  The selection of the winners out of the final round, isX    less clear cut.XX    Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win, but is beat outX    by a similar, but slightly better entry.  For this reason, it isX    sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry X    that failed to win in a previous year.  This assumes, of course, X    that the entry is worth improving in the first place!XX    More often that not, we select a small entry (usually one line), aX    strange/creative layout entry, and an entry that abuses the contestX    rules in some way.XX    In the end, we traditionally pick one entry as 'best'.  Sometimes suchX    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry.  More often, theX    'best' is picked because it does well in a number of categories.XXXANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS:XX    The first announcement, occurs at a Summer Usenix conference.  By tradition,X    this is done during the latter part of the UUNET/IOCCC BOF, just prior toX    the Berkeley BSD, and BSDI BOF.XX    Winning entries will be posted in late June to the following groups:XX	    comp.lang.c		  comp.unix.wizards	alt.sourcesXX    In addition, pointers to these postings are posted to the followingXX	    comp.sources.d	  alt.sources.d		misc.miscX	    comp.sources.misc	  comp.windows.xXX    Winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives.

 Strange exposure problemMessage-ID: <zackC519wy.Gy4@netcom.com>Organization: NETCOM On-line Communication Services (408 241-9760 guest)Date: Mon, 5 Apr 1993 23:14:57 GMTLines: 19Hi, I'm trying to write a Motif program on an Interactive Unix machine, and I'mobserving very strange behavior when my program attempts to expose aDrawingArea. Namely, some Xlib operations work, and some do not. Inparticular, the expose consist of two XFillRectangle calls followed by someXDrawPoint calls, and for reasons unknown to me the point calls are failingwhenever a pulldown or popup up menu is (clicked on and) moved in therightward direction over the drawing area, but after the move, is still onsome part of the drawing area. This also happens less consistently when thepulldown/popup is moved in the leftward direction.Assuming that my code is not doing anything incredibly odd, is this a serverbug?Thanks,Zack T. Smith

The first two years consisted of five subjects:Software Engineering (Pascal/C/UNIX), Computer Engineering (6502/6809/68000 assembler), Computer Theory (LISP/Prolog), Mathematics/Statistics and Communication Skills (How to pass interviews/intelligence tests and groupdiscussions e.g. How to survive a helicopter crash in the North Sea).The third year (Industrial placement) was spent working for a computer company for a year. The company could be anywhere in Europe (there was a special Travel Allowance Scheme to cover the visiting costs of professors).  The fourth year included Operating Systems(C/Modula-2), Software Engineering (C/8086 assembler), Real Time Laboratory (C/68000 assembler) and Computing Theory (LISP).  There were also Group Projects in 2nd and 4th Years, where students worked in teams to select their own project or decide to work for an outside company (the only disadvantage being that specifications would change suddenly). In the first four years, there was a 50%:50% weighting between courseworks and exams for most subjects. However in the Honours year, this was reduced to a 30%:70% split between an Individual Project and final exams (no coursework assessment) - are all Computer Science courses like this?BTW - we started off with 22 students in our first year and were left with 8 byHonours year. Also, every course is tutored separately. Not easy tryingto sleep when you are in 8 student class :-). Cheers,  Michael -- | Michael S. A.

Iwant to specify a widget name in a resource file so that I can connecttwo widgets together on an XmForm. ie.MyProggy*MyListSW.topWidget:               MainTextSWHowever, when I run the program, I get the message:Warning: No type converter registered for 'String' to 'Window' conversion.(Just like the manual sez).I have managed to find this bit of code which seems to be the correct wayto go about this:    static XtConvertArgRec parentCvtArgs[] = {        {            XtWidgetBaseOffset,            (XtPointer)XtOffsetOf( CoreRec, core.parent ),            sizeof(CoreWidget)        }    };    XtSetTypeConverter( XtRString, XtRWidget, XmuCvtStringToWidget,                            parentCvtArgs, XtNumber(parentCvtArgs), XtCacheAll,                                NULL );However, I haven't got a clue where to put it! The example code I have seemsto suggest I can only do this if I am creating my own widget; but elsewhere itsays that I can add it to a widget's "class_intialize" function. HOW? What'sone of those? :-(If anybody has any code to do this, please let me know the trick - I'm surethis is a FAQ.Thanks in advance,Rik.PS: What are the header files "CoreP.h" and "IntrinsicsP.h" - should I use    these or "Core.h" and "Intrinsics.h" (OK I know RTFM:-).=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=.|                               |                                       || Richard Turnbull              |                                       ||                               |       Dept.
